    <h1>LSB?</h1>
    <q>For nothing is hidden
      that will not become
      evident, nor anything
      secret that will not
      be known and come to
      light.</q>
    <p>See <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/image-steganography/#unhide">here</a> for decoding.</p>
    <p>I had originally wanted to hide a longer message, but the scaling on Autolab (800x600 -> 130x97) messed things up. If you came here expecting something very interesting, I'm sorry to disappoint you. If it makes you feel any better, I wasted several hours on this instead of my 151 pset because of the aforementioned issue.</p>
